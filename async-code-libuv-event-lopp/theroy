// Asynchronous
1. More than 1 processes are running at a time.
2. Node is Asynchronous.
3. V8 is NOT Asynchronous.

// Synchronous
1. Only 1 process is running at a time.
2. JavaScript is Synchronous.
3. Hence V8 is Synchronous.

//  Callback
1. A function passed to some other function, which we assume will be invoked at some point.
e.g. : Here callback of fun2 is given in fun1
int fun1()
{
    .........
    .........
    fun2();
}

// Libuv
1. Talks with OS and maintains a queue for the events requested to OS and completed by OS.
2. Once requested, libuv waits for the event to be completed.
3. When event is finished by OS, it callback V8 for doing the processing needed.
4. This is why V8 is Synchronous but Node is Asynchronous
