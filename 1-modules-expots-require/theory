1. Node Js follows Common JS modules pattern
2. Its just a standard of structured modules. 

// First Class Function
1. A function in JS can be used as any other data types in JS(string, array, numbers, etc).
2. We can assign them to variables, put them in array, print them, put them in expression etc..

// Pass By Value and Reference
1. An object in JS is always passed by Reference in JS.

// Immedietly Invoked Function Expression (IIFE)
1. function() {
    ...
    ...
    }
This is a normal function in JS.
2. ( function() {

    } )
Now, wrapped around in paranthesis, this function is treated as expression.
3. ( function() {

    }() )
Now added a paranthesis to Immedietly call the function in the expression.
This is called IIFE
