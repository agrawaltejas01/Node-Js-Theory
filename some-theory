What is Node JS
1. Before Node JS came, JS was a something that could only be used on browser and front-edn tasks.
2. JS could not connect to DB, or make a server, while all other langs could do that.
3. Therefore Node JS was developed for.

1. Node works on V8 engine
2. V8 is written in C ++
3. Therefore Node is essentially written in C++.
4. Node is Server side JS.
5. But it can run Js application on both server side and client side.
6. Node is not JS, it accepts JS and allows us to do more with it


ECMAScript (ES5/ ES6/ ...) => JS is based on ECMAScript.
When JS broke out, different browsers started to develop their own JS engine and hence their own JS. 
EXMAScript was then set as std.

V8
1. Developed by Google
2. Was built to primarily used in Chrome.
3. Based on ECMAScript

Why should we use Node JS
1. It provides Event-driven, non blocking I/O model. 
2. It uses the npm package ecosystem
1.1. non blocking I/O => When Node JS's I/O is running on system, it can do other tasks, making it super
                         Efficient and non blocking. (Generally when I/O are occurring process goes to wait 
                         state. [State Diagram OS])
1.2. Event-driven     => When I/O operation is done, OS needs to tell node JS to resume the code where it left.
                         For this callback functions are used. Calling these callback function tells us that an
                         event has occurred.
2.1 NPM               => Iske toh kya hi kehne :P

                       


What does JS need to manage server ? 
1. Ways to deal with file
2. Ways to deal with dataBase
3. Ability to Communicate over the internet
4. Ability to accept and send requests. (In standerd Format).
